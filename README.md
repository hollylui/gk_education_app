# Project Description

We completed this project at the end of a web development course with the Digital Career Institute (DCI) which is a MERN stack bootcamp. The project was completed in 7 weeks, which included learning NextJS from scratch. 

The user progresses through the game story (in this case, volcano animal rescue) and they answer questions to receive items, which they store in their “backpack”. When the user has received all 5 items, then they will see the “special ending”.  Pre-recorded sound files using the Microsoft
 
NextJS enhanced the performance of our app, enabling all of the html pages to be pre-rendered. We used getStaticProps to pre-render data from our MongoDB database. 
 
We used LottieJS to create animations because we found it convenient to make vectors using AdobeXD and control them using afterEffects. 
 
We used MongoDB to store collections of story text and a collection of educational questions. MongoDB was included in our course curriculum with DCI. 

In the Volcano Rescue Game, we were able to complete 2 short story lines (with corresponding text, images and animations) and the special and regular endings. If we had more time, we would have completed additional story lines. The quiz component also only currently renders math/counting questions out of one age group. We would add additional features to tailor the game to further age groups if we had more time.

## Published Project 

[GK Educational Games](https://gkeducation.herokuapp.com/)

## Idea

As parents, we noticed that the apps on the market for kids are either not educational or they’re not fun. So we had the idea to make an interactive multimedia storytelling app that is connected to a database of school-curriculum-based questions. And we aimed to build this as a framework which could be used to produce multiple games with varying storylines. With this framework, we would build an entire platform for educational games (if we had more time).

# GK Education App with Next.js.

We are four web developerment students 💻 in DCI (Digital Career Institute) who grouped together and work on the final project.

As conscious parents we are interested in finding helpful and engaging materials for our children 🐵 to learn new information and skills. There is a standard age based curriculum that all children must align with, based on where they reside in the world. The standardization of this information is often presented in a way that fails to create engagement and positive attitudes towards said subjects.

Cognitive psychologist Jerome Bruner suggests 📣 we are 22 times more likely to remember a fact when it has been wrapped in a story. Studies show that playing video games 🎮 encourages critical thinking, improves motor skills and promotes key social skills like leadership and team building 🆒.How can we combine curriculum based information, story telling and video games to help children learn❓

## Idea

Enter a choose your own adventure type learning application 🏆 that uses a database of curriculum based information attached to a visual story and game like interaction. The core concept is that in order to progress the story, children must correctly answer curriculum ✅ based questions matching their age group. Incentive type collectible items would be included in the game, these items can be used to help children progress or be used for secret endings. As a choose your own adventure their will be multiple ways to navigate to the end of the story and multiple ways to be side tracked and redirected and given a chance to get back on track by answering more questions or using collected items.

:one: **First, install package**

```bash
npm i
```

:two: **Second, place your mogodb link in .env.local**

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/gk_education?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

:three: **Third, run the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Our Heart of Structure 💙

- Each new game has a folder

```bash
Example of folder name: game_example
```

- Inside each folder, there is one index.jsx file.

```bash
Such as: game_example > index.jsx
```

- All reused components place inside components folder

```bash
  For example: components > ReusedComponentExample.jsx
```

- All others such as audios, data, images... you can place inside assests folder
- For each section (images, audios, or data), it is nice to create a folder related to that game.

```bash
  assests > images > game_example
  assests > audios > game_example
  assests > data > game_example
```
>>>>>>> main

- All contexts will be placed inside context folder

```bash
  For example: context > ExampleContext.js
```

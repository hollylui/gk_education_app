# Project Description

We completed this project at the end of a web development course with the Digital Career Institute (DCI) which is a MERN stack bootcamp. The project was completed in 7 weeks, which included learning NextJS from scratch. 

The user progresses through the game story (in this case, volcano animal rescue) and they answer questions to receive items, which they store in their ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù. When the user has received all 5 items, then they will see the ‚Äúspecial ending‚Äù.  Pre-recorded sound files using the Microsoft
 
NextJS enhanced the performance of our app, enabling all of the html pages to be pre-rendered. We used getStaticProps to pre-render data from our MongoDB database. 
 
We used LottieJS to create animations because we found it convenient to make vectors using AdobeXD and control them using afterEffects. 
 
We used MongoDB to store collections of story text and a collection of educational questions. MongoDB was included in our course curriculum with DCI. 

In the Volcano Rescue Game, we were able to complete 2 short story lines (with corresponding text, images and animations) and the special and regular endings. If we had more time, we would have completed additional story lines. The quiz component also only currently renders math/counting questions out of one age group. We would add additional features to tailor the game to further age groups if we had more time.

## Published Project 

[GK Educational Games](https://gkeducation.herokuapp.com/)

## Idea

As parents, we noticed that the apps on the market for kids are either not educational or they‚Äôre not fun. So we had the idea to make an interactive multimedia storytelling app that is connected to a database of school-curriculum-based questions. And we aimed to build this as a framework which could be used to produce multiple games with varying storylines. With this framework, we would build an entire platform for educational games (if we had more time).
